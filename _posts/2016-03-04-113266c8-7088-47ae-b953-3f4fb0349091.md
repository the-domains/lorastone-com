Lora Stone is a Sai Shakti Healer and Teacher of the Ancient
Indian Divine Knowledge. She lived and studied in Penukonda, South India, for
over a decade under the direct guidance of Avatar/Saint Sri Kaleshwar (Jan 8,
1973-Mar 15, 2012).Lora received
numerous initiations in the Shakti Energy Channels, including advanced yogas
through the practice of mantra and yantra, and Mother Divine darshans. 

Prior to India, Lora trained as a 'trauma' healer with Peter
Levine and Judith Johnson. Her nearly twenty years experience working as a
healer has given Lora the insight and tools to handle all types of heartbreak,
depression, and many types of disease. 

She also guides sacred power journeys to India, visiting
high-energy temples and power spots throughout India. Lora's passion is to help
unlock the Divine power in others and gently guide them to their highest light
and inner truth.
